# 024-005 — EKF gate recovery: consecutive-rejection R-inflation and ekf_rej telemetry

**Completes issue:** `d03-ekf-gate-recovery-path.md`
**Chain:** D3 (depends on 024-004 — `updateHeading()` and streak counter stubs must exist first)

## Description

`EKF::updatePosition()` rejects any OTOS fix whose Mahalanobis distance exceeds the
χ² threshold. With a small P (steady-state or zeroed by `setPose()`, which 024-004
fixes), innovations above ~17 mm are rejected. Once heading drift (D1/D2) pushes the
dead-reckoned position past the gate, every subsequent OTOS fix is rejected and the
filter free-runs on encoders permanently — "confidently wrong, forever."

The fix adds consecutive-rejection streak counters to `updatePosition` and the new
`updateHeading` (stubs were added by ticket 004). After N = 10 consecutive rejections
in either method, R is inflated ×10 for one update and the streak resets. This converts
"permanently lost" to "recovers within ~1 s at 100 ms OTOS cadence." Additionally,
the cumulative `_rejected` count is telemetered as `ekf_rej=<n>` in the TLM frame,
and the Python host side is updated to parse it.

## Files to Touch

- `source/control/EKF.h` — declare `_rejPos_streak` int counter (complement to
  `_rejHead_streak` added by ticket 004); expose `getRejectCount() const → int` for TLM.
- `source/control/EKF.cpp` — `updatePosition()`: add `_rejPos_streak` increment on
  rejection, R×10 inflation + streak reset at 10. `updateHeading()`: same for
  `_rejHead_streak`. Cumulative `_rejected` counter continues for TLM.
- `source/robot/Robot.cpp` — `buildTlmFrame()`: emit `ekf_rej=<n>` when
  `TLM_FIELD_EKFREJ` is set in `config.tlmFields`. `STREAM fields=` parser: recognise
  `ekf_rej` token.
- `host/robot_radio/robot/protocol.py` — `TLMFrame` gains `ekf_rej: int | None = None`;
  `parse_tlm()` adds `ekf_rej` key-value case.
- `host/robot_radio/robot/nezha_state.py` — expose `ekf_rej` attribute on `NezhaState`.
- `tests/dev/test_ekf.py` — **update in lockstep with firmware EKF changes**:
  add consecutive-rejection counter management and R-inflation recovery logic to the
  Python EKF class (`_rejPos_streak`, `_rejHead_streak`). Add `TestHeadingGateRecovery`
  test class: verify that after 10 consecutive heading rejections, recovery update
  occurs. Add `TestPositionGateRecovery`: teleport mock-OTOS 200 mm mid-run (fusion on),
  assert fused pose converges to new truth in < 2 s. Add field-profile fixture to
  `TestSquareFigureEight` covering divergence and recovery.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `updatePosition()` tracks a consecutive rejection streak; at 10, inflates R×10
  for one update and resets the streak.
- [ ] `updateHeading()` (from ticket 004) tracks its own streak; at 10, inflates R×10
  for one update and resets the streak. Streaks are independent — position divergence
  does not trigger heading recovery.
- [ ] **Sim:** teleport mock-OTOS pose 200 mm mid-run (fusion on) → fused pose
  converges to the new OTOS truth in < 2 s instead of free-running forever.
- [ ] `ekf_rej` (cumulative count) appears in TLM frame when `TLM_FIELD_EKFREJ` is
  set. Count rises during induced divergence and falls (or stops rising) after recovery.
- [ ] **Host:** `ekf_rej` is parsed by `parse_tlm()` and accessible as `NezhaState.ekf_rej`.
- [ ] **`tests/dev/test_ekf.py` updated in lockstep:** Python EKF class has per-method
  streak counters and R-inflation logic matching firmware. `TestHeadingGateRecovery` and
  `TestPositionGateRecovery` test classes pass. `TestSquareFigureEight` includes the
  field-profile divergence/recovery fixture.
- [ ] **Field-profile sim (slip on, fusion on):** `ekf_rej` in TLM rises during a
  simulated divergence event, then the filter recovers.
- [ ] Existing `tests/dev/test_ekf.py` and `host_tests/` pass after updates.

## Implementation Plan

### Approach

The streak counters are simple `int` members. The R-inflation logic is a single
conditional block at the top of the rejection path in each update method: if
`streak >= 10`, proceed with `r_effective = r * 10.0f` and reset streak. Otherwise
increment streak and return (reject). Cumulative `_rejected` is already tracked;
add `getRejectCount()` accessor.

For TLM wiring: follow the existing `tlmFields` bitmask pattern for other fields —
check `TLM_FIELD_EKFREJ` in `buildTlmFrame()`, emit `ekf_rej=N`. For the Python
side, `parse_tlm()` already has a key-value dispatch table; add one entry.

### Testing Plan

1. `TestPositionGateRecovery` in `test_ekf.py`: run filter straight for 20 steps,
   then inject a 200 mm position teleport in mock OTOS; assert fused x or y within
   50 mm of new OTOS truth within 20 subsequent steps.
2. `TestHeadingGateRecovery` in `test_ekf.py`: inject 30 deg heading jump, verify
   recovery within 10-15 steps.
3. Host_tests TLM parsing: emit synthetic TLM with `ekf_rej=42`, assert
   `NezhaState.ekf_rej == 42`.
4. `uv run pytest tests/dev/test_ekf.py host_tests/`.

### Documentation Updates

Add `ekf_rej` to the TLM field documentation / protocol reference if one exists.
